### 👋 Hi, I’m Jiajun Wu ( @wujiajunhahah )

I’m a creative technologist with an Industrial Design background, building **HCI-driven, phygital systems** that turn abstract human experiences into **interactive products**.

My current work focuses on:
- 🌱 **Phygital wellness systems** — blending physical artifacts (plants, objects) with calm, lightweight apps  
- 📱 **iOS & spatial interaction** — using depth, motion, and XR to capture moments, not metrics  
- 🧠 **Emotion-first interaction logic** — designing alternatives to data anxiety and over-tracking

Selected projects:
- **RealityBadge** — an iOS AR experience that turns small acts of “leaving the chair” into collectible 3D spatial badges  
- **DreamEcho** — an AI + XR system that transforms dreams into 3D models and physical artifacts  
- **Orago** — a plant-powered pregnancy wellness concept reframing health tracking into daily care rituals

- 🤝 Open to: HCI research prototypes, creative technology collaborations, and experimental product teams

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I turn dreams into interactive 3D worlds — and calm routines into tangible systems.
I’m currently building a series of phygital products exploring how technology can prompt calm action instead of attention overload.
